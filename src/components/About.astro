        My expertise lies in a range of technologies, including <span class="text-secondary">React,
        JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js</span>, and more. My focus is on building
        user-friendly and efficient web applications, ensuring that every line
        of code I write contributes to the overall quality and efficiency of the
        projects I work on.

        While I find joy in solving complex coding challenges, I also embrace
        the importance of <span class="text-secondary">work-life balance</span>. Outside the world of coding, you'll
        find me exploring the depths of the ocean as an avid scuba diver ü§ø or
        engaged in a strategic battle on the chessboard ‚ôüÔ∏è.

        I am excited about the endless possibilities that technology offers and
        I am always <span class="text-secondary">eager to collaborate on exciting projects</span> that push the
