            <p class="text-primary mb-4">My expertise lies in a range of technologies, including React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and more. My focus is on building user-friendly and efficient web applications, ensuring that every line of code I write contributes to the overall quality and efficiency of the projects I work on.</p>
            <p class="text-primary mb-4">While I find joy in solving complex coding challenges, I also embrace the importance of work-life balance. Outside the world of coding, you'll find me exploring the depths of the ocean as an avid scuba diver or engaged in a strategic battle on the chessboard.</p>
            <p class="text-primary">I am excited about the endless possibilities that technology offers and I am always eager to collaborate on exciting projects that push the boundaries of what is possible on the web.</p>
